## We are mapping knowledge as a hard dependency graph.
A map is only as good as the added value it provides. We develop a very specific kind of map. A map made of learning goals and hard dependencies. It provides a clear answer to the question: "What **needs** to be learned so that something else **can** be learned?" in the realm of fields in which every subtopic is foundationally built on other subtopics, such that one is always put in the so called zone of proximal developement (ZPD) in which learning is optimal and engaging as one is not overwhelmed nor underwhelmed by local learning goals that are too advanced or trivial.
To start, we have built this:
![](images/germany_math_graph.png)
It shows the graph we have mapped as of March 20th 2023. The topic is school mathematics in Germany.
You can play with this graph using obsidian by downloading the appropriate mind_base/ folder and opening it as a vault in the downloaded app on many devices of your choosing.

## You find what we do interesting?
- Leave a **star** on the repository or share it anywhere you want.
- Contribute to other or new topics with hard dependencies in obsidian, though do mind that every learning goal has to be written in the computable format that is accesible in the mindbases folder. This is of tremendous benefit to you in the short term if you need or want to learn this topic, as you can test yourself objectively on your current knowledge of this topic, additionally your work is simultaneously accesible to every other person with knowledge of this repository and it's functions, who wants to learn this topic as well. This is especially useful if you are taking modules or classes in university or school and have other fellow students, who are taking the same class and therefore the exact corpus of knowledge you have created.

## Try our old assessment software
For better understanding of your individual competencies in math up until high school you can try out our old assessment-software at the following link.
We are building a similar design in this repository for open use of the openMindBase.

## Techical information
These mapped knowlegde structures are graphs called a directed, acyclic graphs (DAG) with other special properties based on graph theory, which is a branch of mathematics / computer science.
For further infos about the tech lookup "paper/WhitePaper.pdf".

## Project hypotheses
- [x] There are learning goals that can be defined very granularly and precisely.
- [x] Hard dependencies exist between some of these learning goals.
- [x] It is possible to create small learning goal structures manually.
- [x] It is possible to merge small learning goal structures to bigger ones.
- [x] It is possible to create big learning goal structures.
- [ ] It is possible to create big learning goal structures with a big dependency coefficient in topics other than math.
- [ ] It is possible to efficiently work on a big learning goal structure with multiple Persons via GitHub.
