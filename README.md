# mind_base_manager
## We are mapping knowledge as a hard dependency graph for learning (mindbases).

- The graph is acyclic, intransitive and directed (DAG - Graph Theory)
- The knowledge is contained in the form of relatively unambiguous defined learning goals (Nodes). 
- A hard dependency is the link between two learning goals, providing a clear answer to the question: "What **needs** to be learned **in order to** make something else learnable?".

We've developed operable "mindbases" and assessment software to assist teachers and students with finding the zone of proximal developement (ZPD), respectively, learning goals that are not over- nor underwhelming whilst in the  process of learning.

For further infos about the tech lookup "paper/WhitePaper.pdf" (Note: The WhitePaper wasn't meant to live up to scientific standards - it's amateurish).

Starting to study the benefits of use-cases, this is what we've come up with: 
![](images/germany_math_graph.png)

This is the mindbase we have mapped as of March 20th 2023. The topic is school mathematics in Germany.
You can play with this graph using obsidian by downloading the appropriate mind_base/ folder and opening it as a vault in the app on most devices.
<!-- TODO: ## What do we envision with this project? -Lektion aus der gesamten Unternehmung -->
## You find this interesting?
- Leave a **star** on the repository or share it anywhere you want.
- Contribute to other or new topics with hard dependencies in obsidian, though do mind that every learning goal has to be written in the computable template that is accessible in the mindbases folder. 
<!-- sehr komischer Satz -->
This is of tremendous benefit to you in the short term if you need or want to learn this topic, as you can test yourself objectively on your current knowledge of this topic, additionally your work is simultaneously accessible to every other person with knowledge of this repository and it's functions, who wants to learn this topic as well. 
This is especially useful if you are taking modules or classes in university or school and have other fellow students, who are taking the same class and therefore the exact corpus of knowledge you have created.

## Try our old assessment software
For better understanding of assessment software operating on mindbases you can assess your very own state of knowledge in high school math using the following link.
We are building a similar design in this repository for more open use.

## Project hypotheses
- [x] There are learning goals that can be defined very granular and precisely.
- [x] Hard dependencies exist between some of these learning goals.
- [x] It is possible to create small learning goal structures manually.
- [x] It is possible to merge small learning goal structures to bigger ones.
- [x] It is possible to create big learning goal structures.
- [ ] It is possible to create big learning goal structures with a big dependency coefficient in topics other than math.
- [ ] It is possible to efficiently work on a big learning goal structure with multiple Persons via GitHub.
